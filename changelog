1.3.1
=====

Made more compatible with other mods

Surfaces
--------

Uses the surface the vehicle is on, instead of always taking entities from the
default surface (Nauvis). This makes Bulldozer compatible with mods that use
surfaces, such as Factorissimo and Surfaces Remake.

Mining Results
--------------

Look up the mining products for entities. Some entities give items that have
different names than the entity. Rails is an example that was a hardcoded
exception. Mods can introduce other items with the same problem. Rather than
hardcoding each entity, this is a general solution that will work for all
entities, including those added by mods.
